Montage is an app I created in order to solve a problem. I saw that many people often have trouble keeping track of movies they want to watch, and thought I could create an app that makes it easy and enjoyable to do so. I conducted user interviews to understand people's expectations, created prototypes, conducted user testing, an app persona, and finally an app style. I combined all these to design the app with the user in mind.
