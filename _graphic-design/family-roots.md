<div class="work-description" markdown="1">
Family Roots Tree Service LLC is a newly made family business that was in need of a logo to identify who they are. The family had several components they wanted the logo to include such as an image of a tree, a specific color palette, and a rustic feel. I explored imagery and visual concepts that would help contribute to the feel of the business, and created this concept to present to the client.
