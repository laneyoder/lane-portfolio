These shirts were created for the General Store in West Liberty, Ohio. The business wanted shirt designs that did not necessarily promote their brand, but rather designs that might appeal to townspeople or be a souvenir for visitors. I explored several designs that appealed to the store's target audience while still remaining coherent to the store's identity.
