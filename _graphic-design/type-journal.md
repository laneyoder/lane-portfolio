The purpose of this type journal was to collect typography examples of every letter of the alphabet and design a print-ready book that guides you through the typography. I decided to take the reader through my alphabet of typography by planning a trip through China. The reader stops at 5 cities and experience iconic sights and activities at every location. With this book, I got to collect beautiful type examples, plan a trip to China, create a captivating layout, and even use some of my own photography.
