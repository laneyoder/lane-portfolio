Loco Depot Training Station is a new location in Bellefontaine, Ohio, that holds several businesses relating to exercise. The businesses wanted one central logo that did not refer to one single business or type of exercise, and referenced the idea of a train station. After exploring the ideas these businesses desired, I created a logo concept that represented the purpose and feel these businesses wanted to convey.
