With this project, I was tasked with creating my own alphabet and designing a professional poster ready for print. I decided to use sidewalk chalk dust to create the letters so my poster would be captivating and have a life-like texture. Setting up a homemade photo studio in my cramped dorm room, I created each letter using just a stick of sidewalk chalk and a pocket knife. While the process was very slow, I ended up with unique letters that helped my poster stand out.
